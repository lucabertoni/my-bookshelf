## Error codes
### Error code #0 - Assuming that an error occurred
I'm assuming that an error occurred but no errors really occurred yet.\nThat is a safe check meaned to be a remind that there is always an error in the code and to avoid security falls or malfunctions we need to prevent to execute undesired parts of code.
